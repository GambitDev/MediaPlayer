# MediaPlayer

A small music player app I developed as a way to get comfortable with the MediaPlayer object.

A set of songs from the 'raw' resource folder gets load to a list, as the app provides a simple controller to listen to music,
A SeekBar that you can drag and decide which part of the song to listen to, and a timer to notify the user for how long the song was playing and how long it is.

Here are some screenshots from the app

There are some minor bugs and features that should have gotten more attention but this project was for educational purposes only,
I might come back to it in the future to fix these issues and develop some more features such as reading music from device's external memory.
